				Abeliophyllum (White Forsythia, or Korean
				Abelialeaf) is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in
				the olive family, Oleaceae. It consists of one species,
				Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai, endemic to Korea,
				where it is endangered in the wild, occurring at only
				seven sites. It is related to Forsythia, but differs in having
				white, not yellow, flowers.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is a deciduous shrub growing to 1–2 m tall. The leaves
				are opposite, simple, 6–10 cm long and 3-4.5 cm wide,
				pubescent both above and below. The flowers are pro-
				duced in early spring before the new leaves appear; they
				are white and fragrant, about 1 cm long, with a four-lobed
				corolla. The fruit is a round, winged samara 2–3 cm di-
				ameter.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in Europe and North
				America.
